            <p> would highly recommend the Campervan Factory. We have just had our T6 converted and couldn't be happier
                with all aspects of the service and craftsmanship. We received what felt like a very personalised
                service
                with all questions answered without feeling like we were a nuisance, photographic updates and a fast and
                efficient turnaround. Marks initial demonstration and handover were very thorough and Sandy couldn't
                have
                been more helpful. Thanks very much, we are now looking forward to many happy holidays....... when we
                are
                allowed!!</p>

            <p>I would like to thank The Campervan Factory for the conversion they have done on my VW T5.
                I had the conversion done Feb 2012, I am very happy with the quality of the workmanship, appliances and
                the communication throughout the conversion.
                Mark, answered all my questions before, during and after the work was completed.
                I was sent pictures every couple of days of the work being done, and it filled me with confidence
                knowing I was getting my monies worth.
                Regards Paul Sykes.</p>

            <p>Dated 19 August 2018</p>
            <p>We have just returned from a two week tour of Europe, we went on tunnel then drove down France and onto
            south Germany we continued into Switzerland then Austria back up to Colditz on to Koblenz through Holland
            Belgium and finally back to France for the tunnel. 2400 miles fully loaded and averaged 700 miles to the
            tank. The van didn't miss a beat I was soooo impressed. I have attached a couple of pictures for your
            website. Mate I am so happy with the van. I wanted to express my satisfaction with your service. The quality
            of the fit out and fridge which made ice in 39Â°c is great bed comfortable for 2 adults. We've done lots of
            weekends away but this was 2 weeks living in the van, loved it.
            Thanks and kind regards</p>
